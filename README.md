# data-analytics-portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Hugo, and welcome to this project, created to share and learn about this type of data analysis. I have recently been learning a lot about programming for data analysis. I have experience with tools such as Python, R, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI. I am driven by the great initiative of being able to 
demonstrate my skills in data analysis, learning models, and the procedures involved in a data analysis process. Let's remember that we are in an era where
data is the backbone of business, the lifeblood of many companies, and the key to being at the forefront of digitization and globalization.
